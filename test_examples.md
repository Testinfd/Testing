## Section 1: Kinematics

A particle moves along a straight line. Its position is given by the equation:
$$x(t) = 2.0t^3 - 5.0t^2 + 3.0t - 1.0$$
where \\(x\\) is in meters and \\(t\\) is in seconds.

1. Find the velocity \\(v(t)\\) of the particle at time \\(t\\).
   *(Hint: Velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time, \\(v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}\\).)*

2. Calculate the acceleration \\(a(t)\\) of the particle.
   *(Hint: Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity, \\(a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\\).)*

3. What is the particle's initial velocity? (i.e., at \\(t=0\\) s)

4. Determine the displacement of the particle between \\(t=1.0\\) s and \\(t=3.0\\) s.
   The displacement \\(\Delta x\\) is given by \\(\Delta x = x(t_f) - x(t_i)\\).

## Section 2: Newton's Laws and Forces

A block of mass \\(m = 2.5 \times 10^3\\) g rests on a frictionless horizontal surface. A constant horizontal force \\(F = 10.0\\) N is applied to the block.

1. Convert the mass of the block to kilograms. (Remember \\(1 \text{ kg} = 1000 \text{ g}\\))

2. Calculate the acceleration of the block using Newton's second law:
   $$F_{net} = ma$$

3. If the force is applied for \\(5.0\\) s, what will be the final velocity of the block, assuming it starts from rest?
   Use the kinematic equation: \\(v_f = v_i + at\\).

## Section 3: Work and Energy

The work done by a constant force \\(F\\) in displacing an object by \\(\Delta x\\) is \\(W = F \Delta x \cos(\theta)\\), where \\(\theta\\) is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

Consider the scenario from Section 2.
1. How much work is done by the applied force if the block moves \\(12.5\\) m? (Assume the force and displacement are in the same direction, so \\(\theta = 0^\circ\\) and \\(\cos(0^\circ) = 1\\)).

The kinetic energy of an object is given by:
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

2. What is the kinetic energy of the block after the force has been applied for \\(5.0\\) s (using the final velocity calculated in Section 2)?

## Section 4: Universal Gravitation

The gravitational force between two masses \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) separated by a distance \\(r\\) is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:
$$F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$
where the gravitational constant \\(G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2/\text{kg}^2\\).

Calculate the gravitational force between the Earth (mass \\(M_E = 5.972 \times 10^{24}\\) kg) and the Moon (mass \\(M_M = 7.348 \times 10^{22}\\) kg). The average distance between the Earth and Moon is \\(r = 3.844 \times 10^8\\) m.
